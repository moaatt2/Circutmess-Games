# Circutmess Games

## Overview

I recently bought two different Circutmess devices, the `Bit 2.0` and `Codee 2.0` and I have been working on making games for them.

## Games

### Tic Tac Toe

**Overview:**

My goal in making this is to get used to using circut python to make games for the bit and to explore bluetooth.

**Goals:**

I want to include the following in the game:
* Multiple Game Modes - I want to implement the following different game modes:
    * Single Player - I want to have a simple single player mode where the user plays against the computer
    * Two Player (local) - I want to have a basic multiplayer based on passing the device back and forth.
    * Two Player (Bluetooth) - I want to use the BLE connection between two devices to allow users to play with each other.
* Main Menu - I want the game to start on a menu that allows the user to select one of the game modes listed above.
* Background Music - I want to have game music that plays in the background without interupting the flow of the game.
* Sound Effects - I want to have sound effects that play when the user performs an action.
